feat: Add EndpointResponse enum

    This commit introduces a new enum, EndpointResponse, in service.types.ts. This enum provides a centralized location for managing API endpoints, improving maintainability and readability.

    The following endpoints have been added:

    - PREDICTIONS_RESPONSE
    - SIGNPOST_TRAIN_RESPONSE
    - RAIL_ARRIVAL_TIMES_RESPONSE
    - GENERAL_STATION_RESPONSE
    - AMENITIES_STATION_RESPONSE
    - STATION_SCHEDULE_RESPONSE

    This change will simplify the process of updating API endpoints in the future.
