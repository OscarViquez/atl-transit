## Folder Structure

In this Angular Project, we are dividing some of main features in to their own libraries.
Similarly to Monorepos, this would make it easier to scale if need to add additional features and functionality. This can also helps with searching on where the code for a certain feature is located.

### Libraries :

-  <strong> Shared </strong> :
   -  Where we will keep out core UI Components, Types, Services, and Layouts.
-  <strong> Stations </strong> :

   -  Train Arrivals and Train Station Pages.

-  <strong> Buses </strong> :
   -  Bus Routes and the Route Arrivals
