## About this project  
This project presents a conceptual web application aimed at transforming the display and accessibility of information related to Atlanta's Public Transportation. It focuses on providing real-time updates on train and bus times, locations, arrivals, and other crucial aspects of public transit.

This project centers around a **Design System**. This system is carefully built to provide a uniform and easy-to-use interface throughout the web application. It also ensures a consistent user experience for any future updates or expansions of the application

<br>

## Why use Storybook?
To document and showcase the components of the Design System, we utilize Storybook. Storybook serves as a development environment for UI components, allowing us to visualize the different states of these components in a sandbox separate from the main application. This approach promotes better component reuse, testability
